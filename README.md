Project Overview
This project aims to create a seamless and performant iOS app using the combined power of React Native (for cross-platform UI development) and Swift (for leveraging native iOS capabilities). The UI design is built using SASS for styling, ensuring modular, maintainable, and scalable CSS.

Features
Cross-Platform Support: Built with React Native, providing compatibility for both iOS and Android (with minimal changes).
Native iOS Performance: Swift is used for key native functionalities to ensure high performance on iOS devices.
Responsive UI: Styled using SASS for better structure and maintainability of styles.
Reusable Components: Modular code architecture using JavaScript and React Native components.
HTML Rendering: HTML-based content rendering where necessary to keep the design flexible.
Tech Stack
React Native: For building the mobile interface and cross-platform support.
Swift: For implementing iOS-specific native features.
SASS (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets): For styling and UI design.
JavaScript (JS): Core programming logic using ES6+.
HTML: For dynamic content rendering and UI design components.
